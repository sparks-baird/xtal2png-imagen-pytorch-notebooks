# xtal2png-imagen-pytorch-notebooks
Saving notebooks as I run them, even if I might not end up using them for a manuscript and especially to preserve history when I overwrite them. In other words, this is for provenance. For xtal2png teaching and demonstration notebooks, see https://github.com/sparks-baird/xtal2png/tree/main/notebooks.
